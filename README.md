# Naive-image-rotation

Python files for my [blogpost](https://shrishailsgajbhar.github.io/post/Image-Processing-Image-Rotation-Without-Library-Functions).

`fn_imrotate1.py` contains the final function which can rotate the input image with given degrees with two options 'same' or 'full'. The option 'same' creates 
 a rotatated image with same size as input image, while 'full' option produces the output image showing full image rotation of the input image.
 
Usage:

```bash
python fn_imrotate1.py
```
